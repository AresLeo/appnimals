Appsnimals is an Animal Adoption WEBAPP SPA

Developed in VUE-CLI using Vue, Vuex, Css, Js, Bootstrap, MDBoostrap and Firebase.


It is still under development, it is a scalable application and my goal is to continue developing this webapp to be used by animal rescue associations and shelters in Spain.
